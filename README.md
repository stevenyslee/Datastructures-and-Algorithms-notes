## About this repo

This repo will contain my notes on the various algorithms and datastructures covered in the CS course of UCY. The inital repository was attempting to cover all the material covered by the classes but due to time restrictions I am unable to fill all of that content. Instead, I will cover only the most important information instead of bloating the repo.
